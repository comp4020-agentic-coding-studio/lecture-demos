// actions/upload-pages-artifact with no path rewriting), so it's served at
// https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/, not the domain root. Unlike the old Vite
// config's `base: "./"` trick, Astro's own asset links (the CSS/JS it injects
// into <head>) are emitted rooted at `base`, not as page-relative paths — so
// `base` has to match this repo's name exactly or those assets 404 once
// deployed, even though everything works locally.

  // rooted at `base` too, same as the page links above — inlining it removes
  // the only asset link with that problem instead of hand-rewriting how
  // Astro emits build assets.
